# XCjsQuiz

in this challenege i was able to create multiple js pages, one for questions and one for handling the logic of basically the whole application. I was able to create a single html page with multiple different sections and manipulate what was visible to the user by adding and removing from class list in my logic by listening to event listeners such as the start button. I was able to save initials and scores to local storage. I was also able to have a timer that reduced time everytime a question was answered incorrectly.
